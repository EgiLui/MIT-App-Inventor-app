# MIT-App-Inventor-app
The app built using the MIT App Inventor is designed to provide functionality for both shopkeepers
and customers. The app's main screen has three buttons: "Shopkeeper," "Customer," and "Relax."
When the "Shopkeeper" button is clicked app takes users to the "Shopkeeper" interface. Users can
utilise this area to scan QR codes and associate information with the relevant items. By putting
information in the "Name," "Code," and "Price" sections, they can add things to the shop list. The
"Name" and "Price" columns' contents are stored by the programme using two TinyDB
components. Shop owners may effectively manage their inventory and keep an eye on prices
thanks to this.
When customers select the "Customer" button below, they are taken to a page where they can
scan QR codes. On this screen, there is a "Scan QR code" button, a "Total amount" field, an empty
list with "Name" and "Price" values and a "Main menu" button. When selecting the "Scan QR
code" button, customers can see the information for the "Name" and "Price" parts of the scanned
items. The app stores and retrieves the relevant data using the two TinyDB components.
The final button, "Relax," leads users to a screen where they can engage in puzzles and listen to the
calming sound of rain. This section offers a recreational experience for users seeking relaxation or a
brief diversion.
During the design process, one of the challenges faced was storing and retrieving data using the
TinyDB components posed challenges in terms of data management and synchronization between
the shopkeeper and customer sections.
The app built using the MIT App Inventor successfully provides distinct functionalities for
shopkeepers and customers. It enables efficient inventory management, seamless scanning of QR
codes, and a relaxing experience through puzzles and soothing sounds. The challenges faced
during the design process were overcome to deliver a functional and user-friendly app.
